# Pic To GB

## What is this?

A tool for converting pictures into Game Boy graphics!

You select a picture. The picture is cropped and resized to fit the Game Boy's 160x144 display. It's then reduced to 4 colours, converted to tile based graphics and rendered.

You can adjust the contrast and brightness to get a better rendering then download the image or even a ROM to play on your Game Boy!

If you want to get even more of a taste for Game Boy graphics you can limit the number of tiles to 256 or fewer. This will "simplify" the picture and make it look glitchy and blocky.

## Data privacy

Nothing is uploaded. Everything is done locally in the browser and the picture isn't sent to a server.

## ROM?

You can generate a game ROM that you can play in a browser or put on a flash cart to play on original hardware. The ROM just displays the image, that's it!
